// A Node is the fundamental block - a Node represents a square
// on the grid and has many props associated with it such as...
// id, row, column, isStart bool, isEnd bool, isWall bool, distance bool...

// A column ==> array of multiple Nodes

// A row is all the Nodes with the same index in their column array

// Grid ==> array of columns
